[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/b9b258a3-53e5-4733-9b0a-95ef2263b988/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/naughty-jepsen-94fdce/deploys)

Netlify configuration used to host [docc-netlify.josephduffy.co.uk](https://docc-netlify.josephduffy.co.uk/).

It serves as an example of how to host a DocC archive using [Netlify](https://netlify.com).

The website hosts the documentation for [VaporDocC](https://github.com/JosephDuffy/VaporDocC), which is Vapor middleware that serves files from a DocC archive.

The configuration – along with examples for Vapor, nginx, and Apache – are discussed further on my blog:
